As the years went by, the popularity of this opportunity to visit the park in late autumn grew. In the late 80s the open to all comers offer became unmanageable when almost 2000 vehicles per day came into the park. There were traffic jams, people camping illegally, problems with pets and wildlife, food storage and sanitation. In 1990, park management decided to implement a lottery where people could apply for a chance to drive the road over a period of four days after the bus season ended.

In 1934 the Territorial Game Commission prohibited bear hunting within 20 square miles around Pack Creek. One year later, the Civilian Conservation Corps built a trail and a small tree stand overlooking Pack Creek (this stand was replaced with the current tower in 1990).In the mid-1950s a gentleman by the name of Stan Price floated his wannigan float house into the Pack Creek estuary. Over the next several decades his year round presence was a significant factor in conditioning the bears to humans. By the time of his passing in 1989 the bears were comfortable with daily visitors from Juneau.The Alaska Board of Game expanded the hunting closure in 1984 to include Swan Cove, Swan Island and Windfall Harbor -- a total of about 95 square miles.","FacilityID":233328},{"PermitEntranceID":282,"District":"Price Field Office","PermitEntranceType":"Entry Point","LastUpdatedDate":"2015-09-10 07:29:04","CreatedDate":"2014-05-02 18:32:16","Town":"Price, Utah ","PermitEntranceName":"Desolation-Gray Canyons of the Green River","Longitude":-109.91416666666667,"Latitude":39.839444444444446,"PermitEntranceAccessible":false,"PermitEntranceDescription":"Desolation-Gray Canyons of the Green River","FacilityID":233393},{"PermitEntranceID":283,"District":"","PermitEntranceType":"Entry Point","LastUpdatedDate":"2015-09-10 07:29:04","CreatedDate":"2014-05-02 18:32:16","Town":"","PermitEntranceName":"9:45AM - 11:45AM","Longitude":0.0,"Latitude":0.0,"PermitEntranceAccessible":false,"PermitEntranceDescription":"9:45AM - 11:45AM","FacilityID":234642},{"PermitEntranceID":284,"District":"","PermitEntranceType":"Entry Point","LastUpdatedDate":"2015-09-10 07:29:04","CreatedDate":"2014-05-02 18:32:16","Town":"","PermitEntranceName":"7:30AM - 9:30AM","Longitude":0.0,"Latitude":0.0,"PermitEntranceAccessible":false,"PermitEntranceDescription":"7:30AM - 9:30AM","FacilityID":234642},{"PermitEntranceID":285,"District":"","PermitEntranceType":"Entry Point","LastUpdatedDate":"2015-09-10 07:29:04","CreatedDate":"2014-05-02 18:32:16","Town":"","PermitEntranceName":"2:30PM - 4:30PM","Longitude":0.0,"Latitude":0.0,"PermitEntranceAccessible":false,"PermitEntranceDescription":"2:30PM - 4:30PM","FacilityID":234642},{"PermitEntranceID":286,"District":"","PermitEntranceType":"Entry Point","LastUpdatedDate":"2015-09-10 07:29:04","CreatedDate":"2014-05-02 18:32:16","Town":"","PermitEntranceName":"4:45PM - 6:45PM","Longitude":0.0,"Latitude":0.0,"PermitEntranceAccessible":false,"PermitEntranceDescription":"4:45PM - 6:45PM","FacilityID":234642},{"PermitEntranceID":287,"District":"","PermitEntranceType":"Entry Point","LastUpdatedDate":"2015-09-10 07:29:04","CreatedDate":"2014-05-02 18:32:16","Town":"","PermitEntranceName":"12:15PM - 2:15PM","Longitude":0.0,"Latitude":0.0,"PermitEntranceAccessible":false,"PermitEntranceDescription":"12:15PM - 2:15PM","FacilityID":234642},{"PermitEntranceID":288,"District":"Mt.
